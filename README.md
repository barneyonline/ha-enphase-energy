Cloud-based Home Assistant integration for Enphase Energy systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an unofficial community project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Enphase Energy.
>
> The integration relies on undocumented Enphase APIs. Those APIs may change or stop working without notice, which can break features until the integration is updated.

## Supported device categories

- IQ Gateway / System Controller entities and controls
- IQ Battery telemetry and BatteryConfig controls (where supported)
- IQ EV Charger controls and session telemetry
- IQ Microinverter connectivity, inventory, lifetime production, and optional installer-level parameter telemetry
- Site and cloud energy telemetry (including supported HEMS channels such as Heat Pump and Water Heater lifetime energy)

## Key features

- Guided onboarding for site selection and device-category enablement
- Unified support for EV chargers, gateway, battery, and microinverter entities
- Multi-gateway topology awareness for primary/default Gateway and phase selection
- EV charging controls and session telemetry, including charge-mode aware behavior and persistent default charge-level controls when exposed by Enphase
- Advisory firmware update entities for gateway and EV charger devices with locale-aware release-note links; the gateway entity also monitors read-only live update progress, percentage, timing, and sanitized component status when Enphase exposes it
- Heat-pump runtime status, connectivity, SG-Ready mode, power, and current-day consumption details sourced from HEMS endpoints
- Site and battery energy telemetry, including derived grid-import, grid-export, and battery power sensors for Home Assistant Energy Dashboard use
- Optional IQ Battery Scheduler controls and CFG, DTG, and RBD schedule sensors
- Optional current site weather on the Enphase Cloud device, created only when the authenticated Enphase weather endpoint is available
- Independent Microinverter Lifetime Energy and optional installer-level power telemetry
- Site tariff visibility, editable rate entities, and tariff update actions
- Installer-only Grid Profile Control through Enphase cloud Activation, with country-scoped profile selection and current profile monitoring
- Optional manual Grid Mode controls with a read-only status sensor and guarded OTP actions
- Health diagnostics, service-availability tracking, and actionable repair issues
- Read-only System Dashboard event and standing-alarm monitoring, including a
  diagnostic Problem sensor with bounded sanitized event context and optional,
  default-off Repair notifications sourced from authoritative standing alarms
- A site-level System Event History calendar on the Enphase Cloud device, with
  localized descriptions, bounded on-demand pagination, and identifier redaction
- Detailed diagnostic and inventory entities remain available but are disabled by default when they are mainly useful for troubleshooting
- Restored discovery data creates known entities early during startup; live power
  acquisition starts alongside the minimal setup refresh and is attempted within
  55 seconds, while optional feature data fills in incrementally afterward
- Rate-conscious microinverter telemetry uses limited-concurrency bulk reads,
  preserves fresh partial results, and exposes power plus available AC/DC,
  frequency, temperature, signal, and firmware details when available
- Broad localization support across all user-facing integration strings

Localized strings cover English (default plus US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland variants), French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian Bokmal, Polish, Greek, Romanian, Czech, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, and Brazilian Portuguese.

## Quick install (HACS)

1. HACS -> Integrations -> Enphase Energy
2. Install and restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration and sign in

Manual install steps: see the wiki Installation page.

## Compatibility

- Minimum supported Home Assistant version is `2026.6.0` (Python `3.14`+).
- Users migrating from the core Enphase Envoy integration can preserve compatible Energy-dashboard history with the [Envoy History Migration](https://github.com/barneyonline/ha-enphase-energy/wiki/Envoy-History-Migration) assistant. Create a full Home Assistant backup first.

## Authentication

Sign in with your Enlighten credentials; MFA is supported. See the wiki for details.

## Documentation

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/barneyonline/ha-enphase-energy/wiki) for setup,
configuration, and troubleshooting guidance.
